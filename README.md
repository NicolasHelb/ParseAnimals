# ParseAnimals
The goal of the project was to parse through a list of animals and try to get the maximum amount of profit out of that list for the kennel.


Each animal had different properties and values (for example: you can put 4 cats in an enclosure but only 2 dogs or 1 horse and you can't mix animals).

Things could have been better but it has been done in a small amount of time.
